Make sure you have Python 3.7 or 3.8 Installed (dev version recommended).

Great to have Virtual Environment to avoid dependencies issue.

Install rasa and rasa-x following rasa documentation https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/installation/#installation-guide

clone this_repo

cd this_repo

Train the model by typing "rasa train" command in the terminal.

Use command "rasa shell" if you are wishing to speak to the bot in the terminal.

Use command "rasa x" if you are looking for a web based UI in your browser.(This looks more efficient to talk with your bot).

NOTE: rasa x have compatebility issues, so if it doesn't bring up a ui in the browser, try downgrading rasa version to <3.
